# Personal Pokedex  
https://noahdee.github.io/pokedex/
This webpage utilizes a pokemon API and the official pokemon website in conjunction to give the user the ability to enter a pokemon id 
number and either retrieve their stats or add them to their personal team.

# Features
The landing page has an input bar in the center  which prompts the user to enter a pokemon id number. After the number is entered, the user can then click one of two buttons

View Stats: Reveals the pokemon's stats and scrolls to bring the module to the center of the screen. The stats values and how much they are filled are based on the pokemons actual stats

Add to team: Adds a pokeball on the screen, indicating that the pokemon entered has been added to your team. When the pokeball is hovered over with the mouse, a spin animation is activated and the website background image changes to the pokemon it is assigned to. When the pokeball is clicked, that pokemons stats will load into the module and the screen will be repositioned so it is in the center.
